## Inspiration - Nature and the amazing rocks found around the world

## What it does
Use user-given longitude and latitude to find outputs from an AI model run in the backend utilizing Python Anywhere. The latitude and longitude can also be the user's current location as long as the user provides access to the webpage for this location service.

## How we built it 
We used HTML as the framework for the website, CSS for the Stylizing, and Javascript to link the website with our backend: PythonAnywhere. Javascript is also used for the location access system. HTML and CSS help run the majority of the frontend while Javascript and PythonAnywhere (Backend contact area for the AI chatbot). Python is coded on PythonAnywhere. PythonAnywhere is a backend that is linked to the webpage by Javascript and is coded in Python. PythonAnywhere also contacts the Gemini AI host (We needed an API key to access the Gemini Host).

## Challenges we ran into
Implementing the AI and actually making the more complex backend work had MANY issues because we had never used these aspects of code before.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
The fact that we were able to finish and learn the aspects of coding we had never used before.

## What we learned
We learned about implementing AI and complex backends into our code
