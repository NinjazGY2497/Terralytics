TODO LIST:
- Make backend accessible for any project (edit both frontend and backend)
    - Also use env var instead of hardcoding maybe? Figure out how to do both in vscode & PythonAnywhere & github maybe?
- Your location ai generated
- Custom prompt using coords/location
- Location name, not just latLong
- Google maps embed
- Better prompt injection counter
- Radius?
